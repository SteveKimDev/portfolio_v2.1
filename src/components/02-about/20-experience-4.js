              StitchIt Media was a collaborative mobile video application that
              aimed to emphasize the fun and social connection of creating and
              sharing videos. StitchIt provided users with an easy and intuitive
              experience creating 10 second videos to append their video clips
              with one button interaction. The platform seamlessly edited and
              combined videos into one action shot, complete with transitions,
              and the ability to add emojis, filters, music and AR themes.
